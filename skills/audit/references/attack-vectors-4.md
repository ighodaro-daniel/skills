# Attack Vectors Reference (4/4)

125 total attack vectors. For each: detection pattern and false-positive signals.

---

**95. Missing chainId (Cross-Chain Replay)**

- **D:** Signed payload omits `chainId`. Valid signature replayable on forks/other EVM chains. Or `chainId` hardcoded at deployment instead of `block.chainid`.
- **FP:** EIP-712 domain separator includes dynamic `chainId: block.chainid` and `verifyingContract`.

**96. ERC4626 Preview Rounding Direction Violation**

- **D:** `previewDeposit` returns more shares than `deposit` mints, or `previewMint` charges fewer assets than `mint`. Custom `_convertToShares`/`_convertToAssets` with wrong `Math.mulDiv` rounding direction.
- **FP:** OZ ERC4626 base without overriding conversion functions. Custom impl explicitly uses `Floor` for share issuance, `Ceil` for share burning.

**97. Transient Storage Low-Gas Reentrancy (EIP-1153)**

- **D:** Contract uses `transfer()`/`send()` (2300-gas) as reentrancy guard + uses `TSTORE`/`TLOAD`. Post-Cancun, `TSTORE` succeeds under 2300 gas unlike `SSTORE`. Second pattern: transient reentrancy lock not cleared at call end — persists for entire tx, causing DoS via multicall/flash loan callback.
- **FP:** `nonReentrant` backed by regular storage slot (or transient mutex properly cleared). CEI followed unconditionally.

**98. Rebasing / Elastic Supply Token Accounting**

- **D:** Contract holds rebasing tokens (stETH, AMPL, aTokens) and caches `balanceOf(this)`. After rebase, cached value diverges from actual balance.
- **FP:** Rebasing tokens blocked at code level (revert/whitelist). Accounting reads `balanceOf` live. Wrapper tokens (wstETH) used.

**99. Proxy Admin Key Compromise**

- **D:** `ProxyAdmin.owner()` returns EOA, not multisig/governance; no timelock on `upgradeTo`. Ref: PAID Network (2021), Ankr (2022).
- **FP:** Multisig (threshold >= 2) + timelock (24-72h). Admin role separate from operational roles.

**100. Write to Arbitrary Storage Location**

- **D:** (1) `sstore(slot, value)` where `slot` derived from user input without bounds. (2) Solidity <0.6: direct `arr.length` assignment + indexed write at crafted large index wraps slot arithmetic.
- **FP:** Assembly is read-only (`sload` only). Slot is compile-time constant or non-user-controlled. Solidity >= 0.6 used.

**101. ERC1155 Custom Burn Without Caller Authorization**

- **D:** Public `burn(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount)` callable by anyone without verifying `msg.sender == from` or operator approval. Any caller burns another user's tokens.
- **FP:** `require(from == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(from, msg.sender))` before `_burn`. OZ `ERC1155Burnable` used.

**102. Counterfactual Wallet Initialization Parameters Not Bound to Deployed Address**

- **D:** Factory `createAccount` uses CREATE2 but salt doesn't incorporate all init params (especially owner). Attacker calls `createAccount` with different owner, deploying wallet they control to same counterfactual address.
- **FP:** Salt derived from all init params: `salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, ...))`. Factory reverts if account exists. Initializer called atomically with deployment.

**103. ERC721A Lazy Ownership — ownerOf Uninitialized in Batch Range**

- **D:** ERC721A/`ERC721Consecutive` batch mint: only first token has ownership written. `ownerOf(id)` for mid-batch IDs may return `address(0)` before any transfer. Access control checking `ownerOf == msg.sender` fails on freshly minted tokens.
- **FP:** Explicit transfer initializes packed slot before ownership check. Standard OZ `ERC721` writes `_owners[tokenId]` per mint.

**104. extcodesize Zero in Constructor**

- **D:** `require(msg.sender.code.length == 0)` as EOA check. Contract constructors have `extcodesize == 0` during execution, bypassing the check.
- **FP:** Check is non-security-critical. Function protected by merkle proof, signed permit, or other mechanism unsatisfiable from constructor.

---

**105. Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee**

- **D:** `address(target).delegatecall(data)` where `target` is user-provided or unconstrained.
- **FP:** `target` is hardcoded immutable verified library address.

**106. Multi-Block TWAP Oracle Manipulation**

- **D:** TWAP observation window < 30 minutes. Post-Merge validators controlling consecutive blocks can hold manipulated AMM state across blocks, shifting TWAP cheaply.
- **FP:** TWAP window >= 30 min. Chainlink/Pyth as price source. Max-deviation circuit breaker against secondary source.

**107. ERC721 / ERC1155 Type Confusion in Dual-Standard Marketplace**

- **D:** Shared `buy`/`fill` function uses type flag for ERC721/ERC1155. `quantity` accepted for ERC721 without requiring == 1. `price * quantity` with `quantity = 0` yields zero payment. Ref: TreasureDAO (2022).
- **FP:** ERC721 branch `require(quantity == 1)`. Separate code paths for ERC721/ERC1155.

**108. ERC1155 onERC1155Received Return Value Not Validated**

- **D:** Custom ERC1155 calls `onERC1155Received` but doesn't check returned `bytes4` equals `0xf23a6e61`. Non-compliant recipient silently accepts tokens it can't handle.
- **FP:** OZ ERC1155 base validates selector. Custom impl explicitly checks return value.

**109. Missing chainId / Message Uniqueness in Bridge**

- **D:** Bridge processes messages without `processedMessages[hash]` replay check, `destinationChainId == block.chainid` validation, or source chain ID in hash. Message replayable cross-chain or on same chain.
- **FP:** Unique nonce per sender. Hash of `(sourceChain, destChain, nonce, payload)` stored and checked. Contract address in hash.

**110. ERC721 Unsafe Transfer to Non-Receiver**

- **D:** `_transfer()`/`_mint()` used instead of `_safeTransfer()`/`_safeMint()`, sending NFTs to contracts without `IERC721Receiver`. Tokens permanently locked.
- **FP:** All paths use `safeTransferFrom`/`_safeMint`. Function is `nonReentrant`.

**111. Deployment Transaction Front-Running (Ownership Hijack)**

- **D:** Deployment tx sent to public mempool without private relay. Attacker extracts bytecode and deploys first (or front-runs initialization). Pattern: `eth_sendRawTransaction` via public RPC, constructor sets `owner = msg.sender`.
- **FP:** Private relay used (Flashbots Protect, MEV Blocker). Owner passed as constructor arg, not `msg.sender`. Chain without public mempool. CREATE2 salt tied to deployer.

**112. Immutable Variable Context Mismatch**

- **D:** Implementation uses `immutable` variables (embedded in bytecode, not storage). Proxy `delegatecall` gets implementation's hardcoded values regardless of per-proxy needs. E.g., `immutable WETH` — every proxy gets same address.
- **FP:** Immutable values intentionally identical across all proxies. Per-proxy config uses storage via `initialize()`.

**113. ERC777 tokensToSend / tokensReceived Reentrancy**

- **D:** Token `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` called before state updates on a token that may implement ERC777 (ERC1820 registry). ERC777 hooks fire on ERC20-style calls, enabling reentry from sender's `tokensToSend` or recipient's `tokensReceived`.
- **FP:** CEI — all state committed before transfer. `nonReentrant` on all entry points. Token whitelist excludes ERC777.

**114. Small-Type Arithmetic Overflow Before Upcast**

- **D:** Arithmetic on `uint8`/`uint16`/`uint32` before assigning to wider type: `uint256 result = a * b` where `a`,`b` are `uint8`. Overflow happens in narrow type before widening. Solidity 0.8 overflow check is still on the narrow type.
- **FP:** Operands explicitly upcast before operation: `uint256(a) * uint256(b)`. SafeCast used.

---

**115. Griefing via Dust Deposits Resetting Timelocks or Cooldowns**

- **D:** Timelock/cooldown resets on any deposit with no minimum: `lastActionTime[user] = block.timestamp` inside `deposit(uint256 amount)` without `require(amount >= MIN)`. Attacker calls `deposit(1)` to reset victim's lock indefinitely.
- **FP:** Minimum deposit enforced unconditionally. Cooldown resets only for depositing user. Lock assessed independently of deposit amounts per-user.

**116. Hardcoded Network-Specific Addresses**

- **D:** Literal `address(0x...)` constants for external dependencies (oracles, routers, tokens) in deployment scripts/constructors. Wrong contracts on different chains.
- **FP:** Per-chain config file keyed by chain ID. Script asserts `block.chainid`. Addresses passed as constructor args from environment. Deterministic cross-chain addresses (e.g., Permit2).

**117. Cross-Chain Deployment Replay**

- **D:** Deployment tx replayed on another chain. Same deployer nonce on both chains produces same CREATE address under different control. No EIP-155 chain ID protection. Ref: Wintermute.
- **FP:** EIP-155 signatures. `CREATE2` via deterministic factory at same address on all chains. Per-chain deployer EOAs.

**118. ERC721Consecutive Balance Corruption with Single-Token Batch**

- **D:** OZ `ERC721Consecutive` (< 4.8.2) + `_mintConsecutive(to, 1)` — size-1 batch fails to increment balance. `balanceOf` returns 0 despite ownership.
- **FP:** OZ >= 4.8.2 (patched). Batch size always >= 2. Standard `ERC721._mint` used.

**119. Minimal Proxy (EIP-1167) Implementation Destruction**

- **D:** EIP-1167 clones `delegatecall` a fixed implementation. If implementation is destroyed, all clones become no-ops with locked funds. Pattern: `Clones.clone(impl)` where impl has no `selfdestruct` protection or is uninitialized.
- **FP:** No `selfdestruct` in implementation. `_disableInitializers()` in constructor. Post-Dencun: code not destroyed. Beacon proxies used for upgradeability.

**120. ecrecover Returns address(0) on Invalid Signature**

- **D:** Raw `ecrecover` without `require(recovered != address(0))`. If `authorizedSigner` is uninitialized or `permissions[address(0)]` is non-zero, garbage signature gains privileges.
- **FP:** OZ `ECDSA.recover()` used (reverts on address(0)). Explicit zero-address check present.

**121. ERC721 onERC721Received Arbitrary Caller Spoofing**

- **D:** `onERC721Received` uses parameters (`from`, `tokenId`) to update state without verifying `msg.sender` is the expected NFT contract. Anyone calls directly with fabricated parameters.
- **FP:** `require(msg.sender == address(nft))` before state update. Function is view-only or reverts unconditionally.

**122. Read-Only Reentrancy**

- **D:** Protocol calls `view` function (`get_virtual_price()`, `totalAssets()`) on external contract from within a callback. External contract has no reentrancy guard on view functions — returns transitional/manipulated value mid-execution.
- **FP:** External view functions are `nonReentrant`. Chainlink oracle used instead. External contract's reentrancy lock checked before calling view.

**123. L2 Sequencer Uptime Not Checked**

- **D:** Contract on L2 (Arbitrum/Optimism/Base) uses Chainlink feeds without querying L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed. Stale data during downtime triggers wrong liquidations.
- **FP:** Sequencer uptime feed queried (`answer == 0` = up), with grace period after restart.

**124. UUPS Upgrade Logic Removed in New Implementation**

- **D:** New UUPS implementation doesn't inherit `UUPSUpgradeable` or removes `upgradeTo`/`upgradeToAndCall`. Proxy permanently loses upgrade capability. Pattern: V2 missing `_authorizeUpgrade` override.
- **FP:** Every version inherits `UUPSUpgradeable`. Tests verify `upgradeTo` works after each upgrade. OZ upgrades plugin checks in CI.

---

**125. Transparent Proxy Admin Routing Confusion**

- **D:** Admin address also used for regular protocol interactions. Calls from admin route to proxy admin functions instead of delegating — silently failing or executing unintended logic.
- **FP:** Dedicated `ProxyAdmin` contract used exclusively for admin calls. OZ `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` enforces separate admin.
