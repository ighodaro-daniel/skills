# Attack Vectors Reference (1/4)

125 total attack vectors. For each: detection pattern and false-positive signals.

---

**1. ERC721Enumerable Index Corruption on Burn or Transfer**

- **D:** Override of `_beforeTokenTransfer` (OZ v4) or `_update` (OZ v5) without calling `super`. Index structures (`_ownedTokens`, `_allTokens`) become stale — `tokenOfOwnerByIndex` returns wrong IDs, `totalSupply` diverges.
- **FP:** Override always calls `super` as first statement. Contract doesn't inherit `ERC721Enumerable`.

**2. Storage Layout Collision Between Proxy and Implementation**

- **D:** Proxy declares state variables at sequential slots (not EIP-1967). Implementation also starts at slot 0. Proxy's admin overlaps implementation's `initialized` flag. Ref: Audius (2022).
- **FP:** EIP-1967 slots. OZ Transparent/UUPS pattern. No state variables in proxy contract.

**3. Deployer Privilege Retention Post-Deployment**

- **D:** Deployer EOA retains owner/admin/minter/pauser/upgrader after deployment script completes. Pattern: `Ownable` sets `owner = msg.sender` with no `transferOwnership()`. `AccessControl` grants `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to deployer with no `renounceRole()`.
- **FP:** Script includes `transferOwnership(multisig)`. Admin role granted to timelock/governance, deployer renounces. `Ownable2Step` with pending owner set to multisig.

**4. Return Bomb (Returndata Copy DoS)**

- **D:** `(bool success, bytes memory data) = target.call(payload)` where `target` is user-supplied. Malicious target returns huge returndata; copying costs enormous gas.
- **FP:** Returndata not copied (assembly call without copy, or gas-limited). Callee is hardcoded trusted contract.

**5. Missing Storage Gap in Upgradeable Base Contract**

- **D:** Inherited upgradeable base has no `uint256[N] private __gap;`. Adding state variables in a future version shifts all derived contracts' storage slots.
- **FP:** EIP-7201 / EIP-1967 namespaced storage used. `__gap` present and correctly sized. Single non-inherited contract.

**6. ERC4626 Mint/Redeem Asset-Cost Asymmetry**

- **D:** `redeem(s)` returns more assets than `mint(s)` costs — cycling yields net profit. Root cause: `_convertToAssets` rounds up in `redeem` and down in `mint` (opposite of EIP-4626 spec). Pattern: `previewRedeem` uses `Rounding.Ceil`, `previewMint` uses `Rounding.Floor`.
- **FP:** `redeem` uses `Math.Rounding.Floor`, `mint` uses `Math.Rounding.Ceil`. OZ ERC4626 without custom conversion overrides.

**7. validateUserOp Missing EntryPoint Caller Restriction**

- **D:** `validateUserOp` is `public`/`external` without `require(msg.sender == entryPoint)`. Also check `execute`/`executeBatch` for same restriction.
- **FP:** `require(msg.sender == address(_entryPoint))` or `onlyEntryPoint` modifier present. Internal visibility used.

**8. Fee-on-Transfer Token Accounting**

- **D:** Deposit records `deposits[user] += amount` then `transferFrom(..., amount)`. Fee-on-transfer tokens cause contract to receive less than recorded.
- **FP:** Balance measured before/after: `uint256 before = token.balanceOf(this); transferFrom(...); received = balanceOf(this) - before;` and `received` used for accounting.

**9. ERC721 Approval Not Cleared in Custom Transfer Override**

- **D:** Custom `transferFrom` override skips `super._transfer()` or `super.transferFrom()`, missing the `delete _tokenApprovals[tokenId]` step. Previous approval persists under new owner.
- **FP:** Override calls `super.transferFrom` or `super._transfer` internally. Or explicitly deletes approval / calls `_approve(address(0), tokenId, owner)`.

**10. Uninitialized Implementation Takeover**

- **D:** Implementation behind proxy has `initialize()` but constructor lacks `_disableInitializers()`. Attacker calls `initialize()` on implementation directly, becomes owner, can upgrade to malicious contract. Ref: Wormhole (2022), Parity (2017).
- **FP:** Constructor contains `_disableInitializers()`. OZ `Initializable` correctly gates the function. Not behind a proxy (standalone).

---

**11. Banned Opcode in Validation Phase (Simulation-Execution Divergence)**

- **D:** `validateUserOp`/`validatePaymasterUserOp` references `block.timestamp`, `block.number`, `block.coinbase`, `block.prevrandao`, `block.basefee`. Per ERC-7562, banned in validation — values differ between simulation and execution.
- **FP:** Banned opcodes only in execution phase (`execute`/`executeBatch`). Entity is staked under ERC-7562 reputation system.

**12. ERC721/ERC1155 Callback Reentrancy**

- **D:** `safeTransferFrom`/`safeMint` called before state updates. Callbacks (`onERC721Received`/`onERC1155Received`) enable reentry.
- **FP:** All state committed before safe transfer. `nonReentrant` applied.

**13. Nonce Gap from Reverted Transactions (CREATE Address Mismatch)**

- **D:** Deployment script uses `CREATE` and pre-computes addresses from deployer nonce. Reverted/extra tx advances nonce — subsequent deployments land at wrong addresses. Pre-configured references point to empty/wrong contracts.
- **FP:** `CREATE2` used (nonce-independent). Script reads nonce from chain before computing. Addresses captured from deployment receipts, not pre-assumed.

**14. Immutable / Constructor Argument Misconfiguration**

- **D:** Constructor sets `immutable` values (admin, fee, oracle, token) that can't change post-deploy. Multiple same-type `address` params where order can be silently swapped. No post-deploy verification.
- **FP:** Deployment script reads back and asserts every configured value. Constructor validates: `require(admin != address(0))`, `require(feeBps <= 10000)`.

**15. EIP-2612 Permit Front-Run DoS**

- **D:** `token.permit(...)` called inline in combined permit-and-action function without `try/catch`. Anyone can submit same permit first, incrementing nonce. Victim's subsequent call reverts permanently.
- **FP:** Permit wrapped in `try/catch`, falls through to pre-existing allowance. Permit is standalone call separate from action.

**16. Stale Cached ERC20 Balance from Direct Token Transfers**

- **D:** Contract tracks holdings in state variable (`totalDeposited`, `_reserves`) updated only through protocol functions. Direct `token.transfer(contract)` inflates real balance beyond cached value. Attacker exploits gap for share pricing/collateral manipulation.
- **FP:** Accounting reads `balanceOf(this)` live. Cached value reconciled at start of every state-changing function. Direct transfers treated as revenue.

**17. ERC1155 totalSupply Inflation via Reentrancy Before Supply Update**

- **D:** `totalSupply[id]` incremented AFTER `_mint` callback. During `onERC1155Received`, `totalSupply` is stale-low, inflating caller's share in any supply-dependent formula. Ref: OZ GHSA-9c22-pwxw-p6hx (2021).
- **FP:** OZ >= 4.3.2 (patched ordering). `nonReentrant` on all mint functions. No supply-dependent logic callable from mint callback.

**18. ERC-1271 isValidSignature Delegated to Untrusted Module**

- **D:** `isValidSignature(hash, sig)` delegated to externally-supplied contract without whitelist check. Malicious module always returns `0x1626ba7e`, passing all signature checks.
- **FP:** Delegation only to owner-controlled whitelist. Module registry has timelock/guardian approval.

**19. Missing or Incorrect Access Modifier**

- **D:** State-changing function (`setOwner`, `withdrawFunds`, `mint`, `pause`, `setOracle`) has no access guard or modifier references uninitialized variable. `public`/`external` on privileged operations with no restriction.
- **FP:** Function is intentionally permissionless with non-critical worst-case outcome (e.g., advancing a public time-locked process).

**20. Paymaster Gas Penalty Undercalculation**

- **D:** Paymaster prefund formula omits 10% EntryPoint penalty on unused execution gas (`postOpUnusedGasPenalty`). Large `executionGasLimit` with low usage drains paymaster deposit.
- **FP:** Prefund explicitly adds unused-gas penalty. Conservative overestimation covers worst case.

---

**21. Missing onERC1155BatchReceived Causes Token Lock**

- **D:** Contract implements `onERC1155Received` but not `onERC1155BatchReceived` (or returns wrong selector). `safeBatchTransferFrom` reverts, blocking batch settlement/distribution.
- **FP:** Both callbacks implemented correctly, or inherits OZ `ERC1155Holder`. Protocol exclusively uses single-item `safeTransferFrom`.

**22. EIP-2981 Royalty Signaled But Never Enforced**

- **D:** `royaltyInfo()` implemented and `supportsInterface(0x2a55205a)` returns true, but transfer/settlement logic never calls `royaltyInfo()` or routes payment. EIP-2981 is advisory only.
- **FP:** Settlement contract reads `royaltyInfo()` and transfers royalty on-chain. Royalties intentionally zero and documented.

**23. Re-initialization Attack**

- **D:** V2 uses `initializer` instead of `reinitializer(2)`. Or upgrade resets initialized counter / storage-collides bool to false. Ref: AllianceBlock (2024).
- **FP:** `reinitializer(version)` with correctly incrementing versions for V2+. Tests verify `initialize()` reverts after first call.

**24. ERC4626 Round-Trip Profit Extraction**

- **D:** `redeem(deposit(a)) > a` or inverse — rounding errors in both `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` favor the user, yielding net profit per round-trip.
- **FP:** Rounding per EIP-4626: deposit/mint round down (vault-favorable), withdraw/redeem round up (vault-favorable). OZ ERC4626 with `_decimalsOffset()`.

**25. Weak On-Chain Randomness**

- **D:** Randomness from `block.prevrandao`, `blockhash(block.number - 1)`, `block.timestamp`, `block.coinbase`, or combinations. Validator-influenceable or visible before inclusion.
- **FP:** Chainlink VRF v2+. Commit-reveal with future-block reveal and slashing for non-reveal.

**26. ERC1155 setApprovalForAll Grants All-Token-All-ID Access**

- **D:** Protocol requires `setApprovalForAll(protocol, true)` for deposits/staking. No per-ID or per-amount granularity -- operator can transfer any ID at full balance.
- **FP:** Protocol uses direct `safeTransferFrom` with user as `msg.sender`. Operator is immutable contract with escrow-only transfer logic.

**27. ERC1155 ID-Based Role Access Control With Publicly Mintable Role Tokens**

- **D:** Access control via `require(balanceOf(msg.sender, ROLE_ID) > 0)` where `mint` for those IDs is not separately gated. Role tokens transferable by default.
- **FP:** Minting role-token IDs gated behind separate access control. Role tokens non-transferable (`_beforeTokenTransfer` reverts for non-mint/burn). Dedicated non-token ACL used.

**28. Missing Slippage Protection (Sandwich Attack)**

- **D:** Swap/deposit/withdrawal with `minAmountOut = 0`, or `minAmountOut` computed on-chain from current pool state.
- **FP:** `minAmountOut` set off-chain by user and validated on-chain.

**29. Merkle Tree Second Preimage Attack**

- **D:** `MerkleProof.verify(proof, root, leaf)` where leaf derived from user input without double-hashing or type-prefixing. 64-byte input (two sibling hashes) passes as intermediate node.
- **FP:** Leaves double-hashed or include type prefix. Input length enforced != 64 bytes. OZ MerkleProof >= v4.9.2 with sorted-pair variant.

**30. Insufficient Gas Forwarding / 63/64 Rule**

- **D:** External call without minimum gas budget: `target.call(data)` with no gas check. 63/64 rule leaves subcall with insufficient gas. In relayer patterns, subcall silently fails but outer tx marks request as "processed."
- **FP:** `require(gasleft() >= minGas)` before subcall. Return value + returndata both checked. EIP-2771 with verified gas parameter.

---

**31. ERC4626 Deposit/Withdraw Share-Count Asymmetry**

- **D:** `_convertToShares` uses `Rounding.Floor` for both deposit and withdraw paths. `withdraw(a)` burns fewer shares than `deposit(a)` minted, manufacturing free shares. Single rounding helper called on both paths without distinct rounding args.
- **FP:** `deposit` uses `Floor`, `withdraw` uses `Ceil` (vault-favorable both directions). OZ ERC4626 without custom conversion overrides.

**32. Block Stuffing / Gas Griefing on Subcalls**

- **D:** Time-sensitive function blockable by filling blocks. For relayer gas-forwarding griefing (63/64 rule), see Vector 30.
- **FP:** Function not time-sensitive or window long enough that block stuffing is economically infeasible.
