# Attack Vectors Reference (2/4)

125 total attack vectors. For each: detection pattern and false-positive signals.

---

**33. UUPS `_authorizeUpgrade` Missing Access Control**

- **D:** `function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override {}` with empty body and no access modifier. Anyone can call `upgradeTo()`. Ref: CVE-2021-41264.
- **FP:** `_authorizeUpgrade()` has `onlyOwner` or equivalent. Multisig/governance controls owner role.

**34. ERC1155 safeBatchTransferFrom Unchecked Array Lengths**

- **D:** Custom `_safeBatchTransferFrom` iterates `ids`/`amounts` without `require(ids.length == amounts.length)`. Assembly-optimized paths may silently read uninitialized memory.
- **FP:** OZ ERC1155 base used unmodified. Custom override asserts equal lengths as first statement.

**35. Diamond Proxy Facet Selector Collision**

- **D:** EIP-2535 Diamond where two facets register same 4-byte selector. Malicious facet via `diamondCut` hijacks calls to critical functions. Pattern: `diamondCut` adds facet with overlapping selectors, no on-chain collision check.
- **FP:** `diamondCut` validates no selector collisions. `DiamondLoupeFacet` enumerates/verifies selectors post-cut. Multisig + timelock on `diamondCut`.

**36. Storage Layout Shift on Upgrade**

- **D:** V2 inserts new state variable in middle of contract instead of appending. Subsequent variables shift slots, corrupting state. Also: changing variable type between versions shifts slot boundaries.
- **FP:** New variables only appended. OZ storage layout validation in CI. Variable types unchanged between versions.

**37. Proxy Storage Slot Collision**

- **D:** Proxy stores `implementation`/`admin` at sequential slots (0, 1); implementation also declares variables from slot 0. Implementation writes overwrite proxy pointers.
- **FP:** EIP-1967 randomized slots used. OZ Transparent/UUPS pattern.

**38. ERC1155 Fungible / Non-Fungible Token ID Collision**

- **D:** ERC1155 represents both fungible and unique items with no enforcement: missing `require(totalSupply(id) == 0)` before NFT mint, or no cap preventing additional copies of supply-1 IDs.
- **FP:** `require(totalSupply(id) + amount <= maxSupply(id))` with `maxSupply=1` for NFTs. Fungible/NFT ID ranges disjoint and enforced. Role tokens non-transferable.

**39. Non-Atomic Proxy Deployment Enabling CPIMP Takeover**

- **D:** Same non-atomic deploy+init pattern as V76, but attacker inserts malicious middleman implementation (CPIMP) that persists across upgrades by restoring itself in ERC-1967 slot.
- **FP:** Atomic init calldata in constructor. `_disableInitializers()` in implementation constructor.

**40. Beacon Proxy Single-Point-of-Failure Upgrade**

- **D:** Multiple proxies read implementation from single Beacon. Compromising Beacon owner upgrades all proxies at once. `UpgradeableBeacon.owner()` returns single EOA.
- **FP:** Beacon owner is multisig + timelock. `Upgraded` events monitored. Per-proxy upgrade authority where isolation required.

**41. Unsafe Downcast / Integer Truncation**

- **D:** `uint128(largeUint256)` without bounds check. Solidity >= 0.8 silently truncates on downcast (no revert). Dangerous in price feeds, share calculations, timestamps.
- **FP:** `require(x <= type(uint128).max)` before cast. OZ `SafeCast` used.

**42. Block Timestamp Dependence**

- **D:** `block.timestamp` used for game outcomes, randomness (`block.timestamp % N`), or auction timing where ~15s manipulation changes outcome.
- **FP:** Timestamp used only for hour/day-scale periods. Timestamp used only for event logging with no state effect.

---

**43. Precision Loss - Division Before Multiplication**

- **D:** `(a / b) * c` — truncation before multiplication amplifies error. E.g., `fee = (amount / 10000) * bps`. Correct: `(a * c) / b`.
- **FP:** `a` provably divisible by `b` (enforced by `require(a % b == 0)` or mathematical construction).

**44. ERC4626 Inflation Attack (First Depositor)**

- **D:** `shares = assets * totalSupply / totalAssets`. When `totalSupply == 0`, deposit 1 wei + donate inflates share price, victim's deposit rounds to 0 shares. No virtual offset.
- **FP:** OZ ERC4626 with `_decimalsOffset()`. Dead shares minted to `address(0)` at init.

**45. Signature Malleability**

- **D:** Raw `ecrecover` without `s <= 0x7FFF...20A0` validation. Both `(v,r,s)` and `(v',r,s')` recover same address. Bypasses signature-based dedup.
- **FP:** OZ `ECDSA.recover()` used (validates `s` range). Message hash used as dedup key, not signature bytes.

**46. Diamond Proxy Cross-Facet Storage Collision**

- **D:** EIP-2535 Diamond facets declare storage variables without EIP-7201 namespaced storage. Multiple facets independently start at slot 0, writing to same slots.
- **FP:** All facets use single `DiamondStorage` struct at namespaced position (EIP-7201). No top-level state variables in facets.

**47. Staking Reward Front-Run by New Depositor**

- **D:** Reward checkpoint (`rewardPerTokenStored`) updated AFTER new stake recorded: `_balances[user] += amount` before `updateReward()`. New staker earns rewards for unstaked period.
- **FP:** `updateReward(account)` executes before any balance update. `rewardPerTokenPaid[user]` tracks per-user checkpoint.

**48. ERC20 Non-Compliant: Return Values / Events**

- **D:** Custom `transfer()`/`transferFrom()` doesn't return `bool` or always returns `true` on failure. `mint()`/`burn()` missing `Transfer` events. `approve()` missing `Approval` event.
- **FP:** OZ `ERC20.sol` base with no custom overrides of transfer/approve/event logic.

**49. Non-Atomic Multi-Contract Deployment (Partial System Bootstrap)**

- **D:** Deployment script deploys interdependent contracts across separate transactions. Midway failure leaves half-deployed state with missing references or unwired contracts. Pattern: multiple `vm.broadcast()` blocks or sequential `await deploy()` with no idempotency checks.
- **FP:** Single `vm.startBroadcast()`/`vm.stopBroadcast()` block. Factory deploys+wires all in one tx. Script is idempotent. Hardhat-deploy with resumable migrations.

**50. Non-Atomic Proxy Initialization (Front-Running `initialize()`)**

- **D:** Proxy deployed in one tx, `initialize()` called in separate tx. Uninitialized proxy front-runnable. Pattern: `new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(impl, admin, "")` with empty data, separate `initialize()`. Ref: Wormhole (2022).
- **FP:** Proxy constructor receives init calldata atomically: `new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(impl, admin, abi.encodeCall(...))`. OZ `deployProxy()` used.

**51. CREATE2 Address Squatting (Counterfactual Front-Running)**

- **D:** CREATE2 salt not bound to `msg.sender`. Attacker precomputes address and deploys first. For AA wallets: attacker deploys wallet to user's counterfactual address with attacker as owner.
- **FP:** Salt incorporates `msg.sender`: `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, userSalt))`. Factory restricts deployer. Different owner in constructor produces different address.

**52. Metamorphic Contract via CREATE2 + SELFDESTRUCT**

- **D:** `CREATE2` deployment where deployer can `selfdestruct` and redeploy different bytecode at same address. Governance-approved code swapped before execution. Ref: Tornado Cash Governance (2023). Post-Dencun (EIP-6780): largely mitigated except same-tx create-destroy-recreate.
- **FP:** Post-Dencun: `selfdestruct` no longer destroys code unless same tx as creation. `EXTCODEHASH` verified at execution time. Not deployed via `CREATE2` from mutable deployer.

---

**53. Improper Flash Loan Callback Validation**

- **D:** `onFlashLoan` callback doesn't verify `msg.sender == lendingPool`, or doesn't check `initiator`/`token`/`amount`. Callable directly without real flash loan.
- **FP:** Both `msg.sender == address(lendingPool)` and `initiator == address(this)` validated. Token/amount checked.

**54. Chainlink Staleness / No Validity Checks**

- **D:** `latestRoundData()` called but missing checks: `answer > 0`, `updatedAt > block.timestamp - MAX_STALENESS`, `answeredInRound >= roundId`, fallback on failure.
- **FP:** All four checks present. Circuit breaker or fallback oracle on failure.

**55. Flash Loan Governance Attack**

- **D:** Voting uses `token.balanceOf(msg.sender)` or `getPastVotes(account, block.number)` (current block). Borrow tokens, vote, repay in one tx.
- **FP:** `getPastVotes(account, block.number - 1)` used. Timelock between snapshot and vote.

**56. ERC4626 Caller-Dependent Conversion Functions**

- **D:** `convertToShares()`/`convertToAssets()` branches on `msg.sender`-specific state (per-user fees, whitelist, balances). EIP-4626 requires caller-independence. Downstream aggregators get wrong sizing.
- **FP:** Implementation reads only global vault state (`totalSupply`, `totalAssets`, protocol-wide fee constants).

**57. Bytecode Verification Mismatch**

- **D:** Verified source doesn't match deployed bytecode behavior: different compiler settings, obfuscated constructor args, or `--via-ir` vs legacy pipeline mismatch. No reproducible build (no pinned compiler in config).
- **FP:** Deterministic build with pinned compiler/optimizer in committed config. Verification in deployment script (Foundry `--verify`). Sourcify full match. Constructor args published.

**58. Arbitrary `delegatecall` in Implementation**

- **D:** Implementation exposes `delegatecall` to user-supplied address without restriction. Pattern: `target.delegatecall(data)` where `target` is caller-controlled. Ref: Furucombo (2021).
- **FP:** Target is hardcoded immutable address. Whitelist of approved targets enforced. `call` used instead.

**59. Single-Function Reentrancy**

- **D:** External call (`call{value:}`, `safeTransfer`, etc.) before state update — check-external-effect instead of check-effect-external (CEI).
- **FP:** State updated before call (CEI followed). `nonReentrant` modifier. Callee is hardcoded immutable with known-safe receive/fallback.

**60. tx.origin Authentication**

- **D:** `require(tx.origin == owner)` used for auth. Phishable via intermediary contract.
- **FP:** `tx.origin == msg.sender` used only as anti-contract check, not auth.

**61. Upgrade Race Condition / Front-Running**

- **D:** `upgradeTo(V2)` and post-upgrade config calls are separate txs in public mempool. Window for front-running (exploit old impl) or sandwiching between upgrade and config.
- **FP:** `upgradeToAndCall()` bundles upgrade + init. Private mempool (Flashbots Protect). V2 safe with V1 state from block 0. Timelock makes execution predictable.

**62. Cross-Function Reentrancy**

- **D:** Two functions share state variable. Function A makes external call before updating shared state; Function B reads that state. `nonReentrant` on A but not B.
- **FP:** Both functions share same contract-level mutex. Shared state updated before any external call.

---

**63. Integer Overflow / Underflow**

- **D:** Arithmetic in `unchecked {}` (>=0.8) without prior bounds check: subtraction without `require(amount <= balance)`, large multiplications. Any arithmetic in <0.8 without SafeMath.
- **FP:** Range provably bounded by earlier checks in same function. `unchecked` only for `++i` loop increments where `i < arr.length`.
